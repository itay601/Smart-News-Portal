# Smart-News-Portal
Project Title: Smart News Portal
Overview
Smart News Portal is a modern news management platform built to interface with an existing database of news articles. By implementing a robust GraphQL API, the platform allows clients to efficiently query, filter, and modify news articles as well as subscribe to real-time updates (e.g., breaking news notifications). This project serves as a practical learning experience in integrating GraphQL into a production-like environment using a pre-existing articles database.

Objectives
Efficient Data Querying:
Utilize GraphQL’s ability to return only the needed data fields, thereby optimizing interactions with the underlying news articles database.
Data Mutations & Management:
Enable authorized users (e.g., editors and administrators) to create, update, and delete news articles, as well as manage related entities like authors and categories.
Real-Time Updates:
Implement GraphQL subscriptions to deliver real-time notifications for breaking news or updates on trending topics.
Role-Based Access Control:
Ensure that different user roles (e.g., Editors, Reporters, and Readers) interact with the API according to their permissions.
Requirements
1. GraphQL API
Schema Design:

Types:
Define types to represent the key entities in the news domain:
Article: Contains fields such as id, title, content, author, publishedAt, category, and tags.
Author: Holds the author's details including id, name, bio, and profilePicture.
Category: Defines the topic or category of the article (e.g., Politics, Technology, Sports).
Comment: Optional type for user comments, including id, articleId, userId, content, and createdAt.
Queries:
getArticle(id: ID!): Article – Retrieve details of a specific news article.
listArticles(filter: ArticleFilter, pagination: PaginationInput): [Article] – List articles filtered by categories, keywords, publication dates, etc.
getAuthor(id: ID!): Author – Retrieve details of a specific author.
Mutations:
createArticle(input: CreateArticleInput!): Article – Create a new news article.
updateArticle(id: ID!, input: UpdateArticleInput!): Article – Update an existing article.
deleteArticle(id: ID!): Boolean – Soft-delete or remove an article.
createComment(input: CreateCommentInput!): Comment – Allow users to comment on articles.
Subscriptions:
articleUpdated(id: ID!): Article – Subscribe to live updates on an article (e.g., breaking news, significant revisions).
newArticlePublished: Article – Receive notifications when a new article is published.
Error Handling:

Standardize error messages, particularly for scenarios such as data validation failures or insufficient permissions.
Prefer descriptive error responses that help pinpoint the issue (e.g., "Article not found", "Unauthorized to perform this operation").
2. User Roles & Permissions
Editors/Administrators:
Can create, update, and delete articles.
Manage associated entities such as authors and categories.
Reporters:
Can create articles and submit them for review.
Limited editing privileges for already published content.
Readers:
Have read-only access to Article queries.
May submit comments where allowed.
Moderators:
Oversee user-submitted comments and facilitate content moderation.
3. Integration Considerations
Data Access Layer:
Leverage your existing database by creating resolvers that interact with it directly. Optimize the resolvers to ensure that the GraphQL layer efficiently retrieves, filters, and paginates the news data.
Caching & Performance:
Consider integrating caching strategies (e.g., field-level caching) to improve performance when dealing with large volumes of articles.
Front-End Integration (Optional):
Build a basic client dashboard using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue) that consumes the GraphQL API. Display lists of news articles, filter options, and real-time notifications/updates.
4. Documentation & Testing
API Documentation:
Provide comprehensive API documentation outlining the GraphQL schema, types, input parameters, and sample queries/mutations.
Automated Testing:
Write unit tests for each resolver and integration tests for end-to-end API functionality.
Security & Compliance Testing:
Ensure authentication and authorization mechanisms are thoroughly tested.
Ensure that user data and interactions comply with applicable privacy policies and regulations.
Deliverables
GraphQL Server Implementation:
A fully functional GraphQL API that exposes the news articles database according to the requirements.
(Optional) Front-End Dashboard:
A simple front-end demo application showcasing the queries, mutations, and subscription capabilities.
Project Documentation:
Clear documentation including setup instructions, GraphQL schema details, usage examples, and API guidelines.
Test Reports:
Reports from unit and integration testing, along with security audits focusing on data access, mutations, and subscriptions.
Milestones & Timeframe
Week 1:
Setup GraphQL server.
Design GraphQL schema, focusing on the Article, Author, Category, and optionally Comment types.
Week 2:
Implement resolvers for queries and mutations against the existing news articles database.
Develop error handling and input validation.
Week 3:
Implement subscriptions for live updates and integrate caching mechanisms.
Begin automated testing for API operations.
Week 4:
Finalize API documentation and optional front-end integration.
Complete integration tests and perform a review for security and performance.
This specification provides a comprehensive outline of a task focused on applying GraphQL to manage and interact with an existing database of news articles. It emphasizes efficient querying, robust data mutation, real-time functionalities, and strict role-based access control, creating a solid learning platform for GraphQL in a practical, real-world scenario.
